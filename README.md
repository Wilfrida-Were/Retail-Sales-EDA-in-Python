# **Retail Sales Exploratory Data Analysis in Python**

## Project Goal
This project explores a fictional **[Retail sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset/data)** to uncover actionable insights on **customer behavior, product preferences, and sales trends**. The aim is to help business leaders make data-driven decisions regarding marketing, inventory, pricing, and customer engagement.

The analysis will answer the following key questions:

1. Who are our most valuable customers?
2. How does customer age and gender influence purchasing behavior?
3. Which product categories drive the most revenue?
4. Monthly trends in sales and transactions
5. What are the patterns in purchase quantity per transaction?
6. How does pricing affect purchasing behavior?

üëâ Check out the full code in this **[Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wilfridawere/retail-sales-eda-in-python)**

I use the same dataset, to perform **[Retail Sales EDA in SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wilfridawere/retail-sales-eda-in-sql)**
